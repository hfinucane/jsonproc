jsonproc

A read-only /proc to json bridge. In general, the URL scheme looks like:

	/		# Everything in /proc
	/loadavg	# The contents of /proc/loadavg
	/proc/1		# All About Init

When hitting a directory, you should expect a blob that looks like this:

	{ 
	  "path": "/sys/",
	  "files": [],
	  "dirs": ["abi", "debug", "dev", "fs", "kernel", "net", "vm"]
	}

When hitting a file, you should expect a blob that looks like this:

	{
	  "path": "/loadavg",
	  "contents": "0.09 0.12 0.17 1/613 4319\n"
	}

This does nothing special around permissions. If you would like to read
files that are root-readable only, running this as root should work. Because
it's written in a memory-safe language, it's possible this isn't even that
terrible an idea, but, uh, this should not be taken as an endorsement.
