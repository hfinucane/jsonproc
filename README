jsonproc

A read-only /proc to json bridge. In general, the URL scheme looks like:

	/		# Everything in /proc
	/loadavg	# The contents of /proc/loadavg
	/proc/1		# All About Init

When hitting a directory, you should expect a blob that looks like this:

	{ 
	  'path': '/sys/',
	  'files': [],
	  'dirs': ['abi', 'debug', 'dev', 'fs', 'kernel', 'net', 'vm']
	}

When hitting a file, you should expect a blob that looks like this:

	{
	  'path': '/loadavg',
	  'contents': 'MC4wMSAwLjA2IDAuMDYgMS8zOTEgMjc2Mgo='
	}

This does nothing special around permissions. If you would like to read
files that are root-readable only, running this as root should work. Because
it's written in a memory-safe language, it's possible this isn't even that
terrible an idea, but, uh, this should not be taken as an endorsement.
